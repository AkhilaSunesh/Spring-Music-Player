Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a user-friendly interface to control playback, adjust volume, and navigate through the playlist. The project is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

- The HTML file provides the structural foundation for the Music Player. Key elements include:

    1. Details section for displaying current track information.
    
    2. Slider containers for time and volume controls.

    3. Buttons for random track, previous track, play/pause, next track, and repeat track.

- The styling is handled by an external CSS file :

    1. Layout adjustments for responsiveness.

    2. Stylized buttons, sliders, and track information display

    3. Dynamic background color changes for a visually engaging experience

- JavaScript logic :

    Various DOM elements are selected using document.querySelector. The audio element (curr_track) is created dynamically to load and play songs. Track index, play state, and random play state are managed using
variables.
